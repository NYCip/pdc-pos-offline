## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Wave 3 represents the final phase of comprehensive production readiness verification for pdc_pos_offline v2.0.0. This wave orchestrates 7 specialized agents across 3 sequential phases to conduct:

- **Load Testing** - Validate performance under normal and peak loads
- **Stress Testing** - Test system beyond normal limits and failure modes
- **Production Readiness** - Verify all 8 production gates (code, security, performance, compliance, docs, testing, deployment, support)
- **Evidence Collection** - Compile comprehensive audit trail across all 3 waves
- **Operations Runbooks** - Create 5 operational guides for production support
- **Final Authorization** - Make binding Go/No-Go decision
- **Master Report** - Generate comprehensive deployment authorization package

**Expected Timeline**: 25 minutes (04:24:36Z to 04:49:36Z)
**Expected Outcome**: Production authorization certificate + deployment readiness
